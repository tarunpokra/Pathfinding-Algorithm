# Pathfinding-Algorithm
This is currently a work in progress, this program is coded in C++ on Visual Studios. This program runs a window that will pop up and ask for 2 points to be chosen by the user, the program will then determine the shortest pathway to connect the 2 points together. Originally the algorithm when designing this program, used the Big-O mathematical sequence for speed accuracy.
